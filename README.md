# monty-hall variety hour project

Description:
Once upon a time, long ago, in the far off land of 1963, a humble television phenomenon burst into existence: "Let's Make A Deal". And within this show, the late/great Monte Halparin (better known as Monty Hall) started the mathematical typhoon that became known as The Monty Hall Simulation.

How To Play:
The way it works is simple: You have three doors to choose from. Behind the three doors are one sports car and two goats. The placement of these objects are randomized everytime you play. The contestant makes a selection. One of the remaining doors is opened to reveal a goat behind it. The contestant is then given the opportunity to change their door choice.

So What's The Point?:
The point is this: The simulation was structured to prove to even the most jaded of mathemeticians that, by taking the opportunity to change your choice, you increase the probability of winning the sports car.

In this incarnation, the simulation runs through one thousand games and logs and compares the results.
